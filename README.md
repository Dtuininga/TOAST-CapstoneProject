# Final Capstone
Final group project for the April 2022 cohort of Merit America's Java Full Stack Developer Program. 
Worked on by Jungwoo Seo, Nick Mensah, Jesse Goodrum, Adri Valido, and Don Tuininga

The TOAST! Brewery Finder Application was collaboratively designed and built as a team effort with daily Scrum meetings in an Agile format. 
For our presentation, we scored a 9.38 out of possible 10 (points removed for not including error handling (bad password, etc) and some presentation aesthetics)
This repo is intended to be my personal version to tinker with and improve for practice and experimentation.
